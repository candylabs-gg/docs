**Dev Specification: Trait Secondary Marketplace**

**Version:** v1

**Feature Owner:** CTO

**Technical Leads:** Frontend Dev, Backend Dev

**Sprint Blockers:** None currently

**Dependencies:** Supabase schema finalization, wallet connection flow

**Priority:** MVP-critical

**Target Completion:** May 5, 2025

---

**Module Overview**

This module enables users to list unequipped NFT traits for sale, browse global/collection trait marketplaces, and purchase traits from other users. The system must support trait ownership tracking, dynamic rarity calculations, secure escrow listing, and customization logic integration.

---

**Technical Scope Breakdown**

**üîß Backend Responsibilities**

**1\. Database Schema Updates**

‚Ä¢ trait\_items table: (actually user\_traits\_inventory)

‚Ä¢ Add: listed (bool), price (decimal), currency, listing\_id (uuid), created\_at, updated\_at

‚Ä¢ listings table:

‚Ä¢ listing\_id

‚Ä¢ item\_id

‚Ä¢ seller\_id

‚Ä¢ price

‚Ä¢ currency

‚Ä¢ status (active, sold, cancelled)

‚Ä¢ buyer\_id

‚Ä¢ created\_at, updated\_at

‚Ä¢ Ensure trait ‚Üí user ‚Üí NFT ‚Üí collection relations are intact

**2\. API Routes (4.18.25)**

**PM Tips**

‚Ä¢ Each user-facing flow (inventory, list, buy, view trait) should have a corresponding Jira story.

‚Ä¢ Tag backend-heavy stories with backend, same for frontend.

‚Ä¢ Use blocked status for frontend tasks waiting on API completion.

‚Ä¢ Developers should link commits \+ PRs to their stories.

‚Ä¢ PM can track readiness by watching /list, /buy, and /inventory endpoints hit readiness.

**Dev Specification: Candy Mint Launchpad (User-Facing)**

**Version:** v1

**Feature Owner:** CTO

**Technical Leads:** Backend Dev, Frontend Dev

**PM Support:** Project Manager

**Target Completion:** May 1, 2025

---

**Module Overview**

This module allows users to mint dynamic, customized NFTs from Candy-partnered Solana collections. It includes:

‚Ä¢ A launchpad landing page

‚Ä¢ A trait customization interface

‚Ä¢ Real-time image generation from user-selected traits

‚Ä¢ Metadata generation and upload

‚Ä¢ Minting logic to create and send the NFT to the user‚Äôs wallet

‚Ä¢ Syncing that NFT to the user‚Äôs Candy account backend

---

**üì¶ Scope & Assumptions**

‚Ä¢ Collection setup (trait definitions, pricing, stock) is handled by a separate creator dashboard system (out of scope).

‚Ä¢ All trait images exist as layered PNGs with transparent backgrounds.

‚Ä¢ The launchpad supports dynamic metadata generation per NFT (not pre-generated).

‚Ä¢ NFTs must be minted using compliant Metaplex metadata and Solana best practices to ensure marketplace compatibility.

‚Ä¢ Trait inventory is limited by supply caps defined per trait.

---

**üîß Backend Responsibilities**

**1\. Image Generation Pipeline**

‚Ä¢ Stack selected PNGs based on collection layer order.

‚Ä¢ Output single PNG with transparent background.

‚Ä¢ Save file locally or buffer for upload.

**2\. Metadata Generation**

‚Ä¢ Generate Metaplex-compliant JSON using:

‚Ä¢ Trait values (type \+ value pairs)

‚Ä¢ IPFS URL of generated image

‚Ä¢ Collection name, symbol, creators, royalty, etc.

‚Ä¢ Ensure uniqueness per mint.

**3\. IPFS Upload Service**

‚Ä¢ Upload generated PNG \+ metadata JSON to:

‚Ä¢ Pinata (via API key auth), or

‚Ä¢ DigitalOcean Spaces (using CDN endpoint)

‚Ä¢ Return public image\_url and metadata\_url.

**4\. Mint Handler (Solana)**

‚Ä¢ Use Metaboss CLI or custom mint signer (Docker-based or RPC)

‚Ä¢ Mint NFT to connected wallet with:

‚Ä¢ Name

‚Ä¢ URI (from uploaded metadata)

‚Ä¢ Collection assignment

‚Ä¢ Verified creator

‚Ä¢ Royalty / seller\_fee\_basis\_points

‚Ä¢ Ensure collection NFT metadata is set correctly

**5\. Trait Stock Enforcement**

‚Ä¢ On mint attempt:

‚Ä¢ Lock/validate trait availability (e.g., if ‚ÄúRed Hoodie‚Äù has 0 supply left, reject)

‚Ä¢ Traits should decrement supply post-successful mint.

**6\. Candy Backend Sync**

‚Ä¢ Store newly minted NFT:

‚Ä¢ NFT public key

‚Ä¢ user\_id

‚Ä¢ metadata\_url

‚Ä¢ image\_url

‚Ä¢ selected trait IDs

‚Ä¢ Used for later inventory tracking \+ customizations

---

**1\. Launchpad Page**

‚Ä¢ Display all active or upcoming collections:

‚Ä¢ Title, art, description

‚Ä¢ Countdown to mint start

‚Ä¢ Supply progress bar

**2\. Trait Customization Interface**

‚Ä¢ Load available traits for collection via API

‚Ä¢ Display categories (e.g., background, headwear)

‚Ä¢ Show image previews \+ availability

‚Ä¢ Optional point system:

‚Ä¢ Display current point total

‚Ä¢ Show per-trait cost

‚Ä¢ Deduct on selection

‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúRandomize‚Äù button to auto-generate combo

‚Ä¢ Consider caching common trait combinations to speed up image rendering.

‚Ä¢ PM should tag each frontend and backend task for sprint assignment, and track blocked status on mint handler.
